# Blurfnes's DDOSing-Software
This is the current DDOS Software V1
This was supposed to be a side project but currently I am trying to 
make it into a all in one internet security terminal app for windows computers

# How to run?
Just run the start.bat file everything else is self explanatory.
# FAQ

No because those OS can not run terminal files like .vbs or .bat which is windows only
